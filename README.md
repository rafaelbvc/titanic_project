## User Stories

Passenger List View

### Front-End

User Story: As a user, I want to see a passenger list with basic information (Name, Age, Sex, Class, Survival Status) to quickly understand passenger details.
Technologies: React, TypeScript

### Acceptance Criteria:

Table with columns for PassengerID, Name, Sex, Age, Class (Pclass), and Survival Status
Search function by name and filter options by Class (Pclass), Survival (Survived), and Sex (NR)
Responsive design
Pagination (NR)

### Back-End

User Story: As a system, I need to store and make passenger data accessible to the front-end so that users can retrieve and view the passenger list.
Technologies: Node.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, PostgreSQL (as SQL model)

### Acceptance Criteria:

Endpoints to retrieve the passenger list with fields PassengerID, Survival (Survived), Class (Pclass), Name, Sex, and Age
Database optimized for fast queries with appropriate indexes (NR) 2. Survival Analysis by Attributes

### Front-End

User Story: As a user, I want to see survival rates segmented by Class, Sex, and Age to analyze trends (NR)
Technologies: React, TypeScript

### Acceptance Criteria:

Charts showing survival distribution by class, gender, and age groups (NR)
Tooltips to display percentages and counts (NR)

### Back-End

User Story: As a system, I need to process and return data on survival rates by key attributes so that users can gain insights.
Technologies: Node.js, PostgreSQL

### Acceptance Criteria:

API endpoints that calculate and return survival statistics segmented by Class (Pclass), Sex, and Age (NR)
Pre-aggregated data for optimized response (NR / Refactoring / Optimization)
Detailed Passenger View

### Front-End

User Story: As a user, I want to click on a passengerâ€™s name to view detailed information (Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarkation Port) for a complete profile.
Technologies: React, TypeScript

### Acceptance Criteria:

Dedicated page or modal with fields PassengerID, Survival (Survived), Class (Pclass), Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, and Embarked
"Back to List" option and error handling for missing data

### Back-End

User Story: As a system, I need to fetch and return complete information for each passenger by PassengerID to display detailed profiles.
Technologies: Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL

### Acceptance Criteria:

API endpoint to retrieve detailed data by PassengerID
Error handling for invalid or non-existent PassengerID
Roadmap for Project Titanic

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 (MVP)

[]-Develop Passenger List View with basic information display.\*
[]-Implement search functionality for passenger names.\*
[]-Set up API endpoints for listing passengers.\*
[]-Ensure basic data storage and retrieval functionality with MongoDB/PostgreSQL.\*

### Phase 2 (Next Release - NR)

[]-Add pagination and filter options to the Passenger List.\*
[]-Implement Survival Analysis by Attributes (Front and Back-End).\*
[]-Create Detailed Passenger View for profile display.\*
[]-Develop the filter and search functionality with advanced criteria.\*
[]-Start Dashboard Development for aggregated insights.\*

### Phase 3 (Enhanced Features and Admin Control)

[]-Build the Data Dashboard for insights and trends.\*
[]-Implement Admin Functionality for passenger data management.\*
[]-Add role-based access control for data management.\*
[]-Optimize database queries and add pre-aggregated data for speed.\*
[]-Improve user interface and error handling across all pages.\*

## Todo List

### Back-End

[]-Create initial database schemas and models.\*
[]-Set up endpoints for Passenger List and search functionality.\*
[]-Implement data retrieval by PassengerID for Detailed Passenger View.\*
[]-Set up survival analysis endpoints for future NR phase.\*
[]-Implement admin access and role-based permissions.\*
[]-Optimize queries and indexing for better performance (NR).\*

### Front-End

[]-Develop Passenger List View component.\*
[]-Implement search bar and filter options.\*
[]-Create detailed Passenger View page/modal.\*
[]-Start Survival Analysis charts with placeholders for NR phase.\*
[]-Design and build Dashboard components.\*
[]-Implement Admin pages for managing passenger records (NR).\*

### Testing & Documentation

[]-Write unit and integration tests for front-end and back-end.\*
[]-Document API endpoints and usage for developers.\*
[]-Ensure responsiveness for mobile devices across all components.\*
